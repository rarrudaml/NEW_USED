# NEW vs USED Challenge:

## Objective:

In the context of Mercadolibre's Marketplace an algorithm is needed to predict if an item listed in the marketplace is new or used.

Your tasks involve the data analysis, designing, processing and modeling of a machine learning solution to predict if an item is new or used and then evaluate the model over held-out test data.

To assist in that task a dataset is provided in `MLA_100k_checked_v3.jsonlines` and a function `build_dataset` to read that dataset in `new_or_used.py`.

For the evaluation, you will use the accuracy metric in order to get a result of 0.86 as minimum. Additionally, you will have to choose an appropriate secondary metric and also elaborate an argument on why that metric was chosen.


## Pre-reqs:

Enable some virtual env with required packages:
`virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
